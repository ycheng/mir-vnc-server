mirvncserver

Currently we don't have vnc server for mir. This is a try.

screencast.cpp:
	from mir-0.1.9
dummyvncserver.c:
	reduced from sample code of libvncserver 0.9.9

dependency:
	vncserver: libvncserver-dev v0.9.9
	mirscreencast:
		libmirclient-dev libmirprotobuf-dev libmirserver-dev
		libgles2-mesa-dev
		libboost-program-options-dev

	Currently this also compiled on mir 0.1.8 on trusty.
